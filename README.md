## _Hands on Workshop for your first step towards natural disaster management_

:boom: Calling all rockstar coders! :boom:

IBM Developer SF is hosting a workshop to help you gain the skills necessary to enter a project to [Call for Code](https://callforcode.org/).

Call for Code is a global hackathon dedicated to finding a solution for natural disasters. 

### _What is Call for Code?_ :thought_balloon:

100,000 developers from 156 nations accepted the challenge and built over 2,500 applications in 2018.

Winners of Call for Code last year has won $200,000 in cash prize as well as gaining [global recognition for their work](https://youtu.be/ZXkGAokhGl8).

### _What will you learn from the workshop?_ :computer: :books:

During the workshop, we will be:
1. sharing more information about Call for Code
2. covering IBM services [Watson services and weather data] that can be used for a natural disaster use case. 
3. helping you brainstorm possible Call for Code project ideas

We will learn how to integrate weather insights with a chatbot. The user of the chatbot will be able to get the weather conditions of a location by entering it in the bot.

At the end of the workshop, we will have learned how to -

* Build a simple chatbot using [Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant).
* Extract location data from the user input to the chatbot.
* Use the [Weather Company Data](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/weather-company-data) to get the weather of a location.
* Connect everything using a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) application deployed to [Kubernetes](https://cloud.ibm.com/containers-kubernetes/catalog/cluster).

## Prerequisite

* Laptops (charging ports will be provided).
* Signup for an IBM cloud account if you don't have one - [Here](http://ibm.biz/weatherbots_IBMDeveloperSF)
