# Weatherbot

So you've been hearing a lot of buzz about Chatbots and Serverless tech, but how exactly do we build a chatbot using IBM Watson Assistant, and connect it with a Serverless Backend for custom use-cases.

Bring your laptop and come find out at IBM Developer SF's meetup!

During the workshop, we will learn how to integrate weather insights with a chatbot. The user of the chatbot will be able to know the weather conditions of a location by entering it in the bot.

At the end of the hands-on workshop, we would have learned:
- How to build a simple chatbot using IBM Watson Assistant.
- What are intents, entities and dialog flows in Natural Language Understanding (NLU)?
- What is Serverless tech, the benefits, and who are the players in the Serverless ecosystem?
- How to create a Serverless function which can interact and retrieve weather insights using the Weather Data Company API.
- How to integrate our chatbot with our custom serverless function.

What are you waiting for?
