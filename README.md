# sjsu-workshop (March 26, 2019)
We will learn how to integrate weather insights with a chatbot. The user of the chatbot will be able to get the weather conditions of a location by entering it in the bot.

At the end of the workshop, we will have learned how to -

* Build a simple chatbot using [Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant).
* Extract location data from the user input to the chatbot.
* Use the [Weather Company Data](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/weather-company-data) to get the weather of a location.
* Connect everything using a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) application deployed to [Kubernetes](https://cloud.ibm.com/containers-kubernetes/catalog/cluster).

## Prerequisite

* Laptops (charging ports will be provided).
* Signup for an IBM cloud account if you don't have one - [Here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration)
